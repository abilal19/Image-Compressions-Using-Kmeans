# Image-Compressions-Using-Kmeans

Built from scratch an image compression algorithm using Kmeans with varying number of centeroids and optional optimization parametes with their illustrated effects. The mathematical proof for the maximum reduction in the distortion function in each iterative step can be found in the introduction file.
