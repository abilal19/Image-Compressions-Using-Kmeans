# Image-Compressions-Using-Kmeans

Built from scratch an image compression algorithm using Kmeans with varying number of centeroids and optional optimization parameters with their illustrated effects on efficiency. The mathematical explanation for the maximum reduction in the non-convex distortion function in each iterative step towards the local minimum can be found in the K-Means Image Compression Algorithm Explanation file.
